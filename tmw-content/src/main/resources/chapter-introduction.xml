  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The ideas of this book is to describe the conventions
    and the so called Maven Way in doing things in relationship
    with Maven.

  <para>I'm trying not to dive to deep into configuration details
    of Maven cause they have been well documented already. Ok ok. I'm
    not telling the whole truth, cause in some areas I can't
    avoid that to transfer a better understanding of the why and
    why not.
  </para>

  <para>If you are working with Maven and in particular in having
    problems and asking questions in forums or other popular areas

    it this way. You should go "The Maven Way."
  </para>
