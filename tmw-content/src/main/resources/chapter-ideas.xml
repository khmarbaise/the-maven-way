    <para>What is a release from the Maven point of view? 
    <emphasis>The Maven Way</emphasis> is about to start with a version
    which has a <literal>-SNAPSHOT</literal> postfix added. This identifies
    this version as a so called SNAPSHOT-release<footnote><para>To be honest the word release
    in this case does not make really sense</para></footnote>. Let use assume the following
    SNAPSHOT-release <literal>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</literal>. You can deploy
    a SNAPSHOT-release everytime you changed something in your project which 
    also can be used as a dependency in other projects. Everytime you deploy
    an other SNAPSHOT this means the earlier one will get invalid. 
    But based on the SNAPSHOT identity you can't be sure which exact state of 
    your project this SNAPSHOT represents. So SNAPSHOT's are only intended 
    during the development. After you have finished your development you will 
    make a release out of it. This will change the earlier mentioned 
    <literal>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</literal> into <literal>1.0.0</literal>.
